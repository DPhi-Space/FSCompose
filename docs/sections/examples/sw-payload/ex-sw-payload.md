# Software Payload

*Because not everything is hardware*

## Introduction

A payload does not necessarily have to be of a hardware nature. Let's say we want to test algorithms in space with real time data of the satellite, be it images, radiation leves, etc. Why would such a payload be hardware? Why develop a whole new payload if there is already the sensors we need on-board? This is where software payloads come in.
